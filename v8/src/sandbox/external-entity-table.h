/**
 * A thread-safe table with a fixed maximum size for storing references to
 * objects located outside of the sandbox.
 *
 * An external entity table provides the basic mechanisms to ensure
 * safe access to objects located outside the sandbox, but referenced
 * from within it. When an external entity table is used, objects located
 * inside the sandbox reference outside objects through indices into the table.
 *
 * The ExternalEntityTable class should be seen an an incomplete class that
 * needs to be extended by a concrete implementation class, such as the
 * ExternalPointerTable class, as it is lacking some functionality. In
 * particular, while the ExternalEntityTable implements the reserving, growing,
 * and shrinking of the backing memory as well as entry allocation routines, it
 * does not implement any logic for reclaiming entries such as garbage
 * collection. This must be done by the child classes.
